                <p>Hi everybody, let's talk about digital marketing basics. Now these are some basic marketing
                  techniques
                  that you can use to grow your business. It used to be that you could rely on SEO and organic search to
                  return you as a result in Google to people and serve you up as a possibility for them to visit, and
                  it's
                  not really that way anymore. It's really a David and Goliath story out there there were big players in
                  whatever market niche that you're in will have bought up all the keywords that people are searching
                  for, and
                  it's very difficult to show up in search. It's not impossible, but it's much more difficult than it
                  used
                  to be, so I'm gonna talk about some marketing techniques that have to do with search,
                  but also a lot of them are techniques that you can use that don't rely on search in order to grow your
                  business. </p>

                <p>It used to be that if you had a whole lot of text on your homepage, and use keywords effectively,
                  you could elevate yourself in search. Now you can still use meta tags and browser tags and meta
                  descriptions on your page. Uou could even use an SEO plugin for WordPress to help you with SEO and
                  search,
                  but when it comes down to it these days you can't rely entirely on that. You need to rely on other
                  digital marketing methods to drive people to your site. I'm going to talk about five. Email marketing,
                  paid
                  advertising, content marketing, social media presence, and blog posts. </p>

                <p>Let's talk about email marketing a little bit. Contrary to popular belief email marketing is not
                  dead, email is still the favored form of
                  communication between companies and customers, because companies can collect email addresses and
                  target
                  who they are communicating to, and customers can give up their email addresses so they're getting
                  messages from companies they really want to hear from. Newsletters are a great form of email
                  marketing,
                  you can develop valuable content that's targeted to your customer, and provide it to them through a
                  newsletter.</p>

                <p>So let's talk about paid digital advertising. Like I said earlier, you really can't rely on SEO
                  entirely, you really have to eventually do some paid advertising. The good thing is that paid
                  advertising
                  doesn't have to cost a lot in order to have an impact. You can use for one thing Google AdWords, so
                  using
                  Google Ad one form of paid advertising, it's a text-based form of advertising and it's very kind of
                  short
                  snippet sentences that you use in Google AdWords, and so keywords are really important, and as I said
                  before the whole David and Goliath story is that the larger companies in certain categories have
                  bought
                  up and really owned the keywords in certain categories, so you're gonna have to leverage longtail
                  keywords, and you can do some research on what I mean by that to write your Google ads, and then you
                  want
                  an a/b test, so you want to have a number of different ads that do the same thing, or give the same
                  message in slightly different ways, and then use Google Analytics to track which of those ads do
                  better
                  over time, and then leverage the ones that are succeeding and build off of the ones that are
                  succeeding.</p>

                <p>Another form of paid advertising is Facebook Ads, Facebook ads are relatively, in comparison to
                  Adwords,
                  they can be cheap, the other great thing about Facebook is that their targeting capabilities are
                  really
                  incredible, you can target super specifically geographically, demographically, income, based on so
                  many
                  different levels, who is going to view your ad so by spending, and by targeting specifically you can
                  make
                  the most of your advertising. </p>

                <p>Now your social media profiles are also a really important form of digital marketing, you want to
                  make sure that you're featuring links to your social profiles on your
                  website. Google will penalize you if you don't have links to your social profiles on your website, you
                  should have twitter and facebook at a bare minimum, but you want to make sure that you don't go
                  overboard,
                  you don't want to be on so many different social platforms that you show up on them poorly, you want
                  to
                  do a few and you want to do them well, so I recommend people starting with just a couple and seeing
                  how
                  well they engage on them, and how they build their audience, and then growing that over time as they
                  get
                  better at dealing with the show's social landscape. Plus don't forget video, because Google owns
                  YouTube,
                  having video on your site whether it's curated videos of other people's content, or developing your
                  own
                  content, having those links on your site back to YouTube really elevates you on SEO, so don't forget
                  about
                  video. </p>

                <p>Another important form of digital marketing for small businesses and entrepreneurs, is content
                  marketing, content marketing is using original content, or curated content to draw people to your
                  website.
                  It's giving them something of value to come to you for, and when they come to you, you ask them for
                  their
                  email address, and in return for them giving up your their email address you give them what we call
                  opt-in magnets, so that's a thing like an e-book, or a PDF, or a checklist, or resource lists or,
                  how-to
                  videos, they get something in return for signing up for your list. You can also use landing pages,
                  landing
                  pages don't show up on the main navigation of your site, but it's where people land when they come to
                  your site, in order to get some sort of opt-in content, and they may give up their email address
                  there, and
                  then they may be led to your content, or led to your main website. But landing pages can be keyword
                  rich
                  and therefore really benefit your site in SEO, without actually being part of your main site. And
                  remember,
                  it doesn't have to all be original content on your site, you can use curated content on your site,
                  articles, blog posts from other people, links, resources, make sure to attribute to the original
                  producer
                  and get permission in order to do that, but there's ways to add content to your site without you
                  having to become a content producer, but becoming a content producer is really the best way to go
                  about
                  it. </p>

                <p>So let's talk about blogging. A little bit blogging is really important for SEO, especially for small
                  businesses entrepreneurs, and creative professionals. It's the one thing that they can do that can
                  really
                  help SEO. Why? Well when you blog post, you post regularly to your sites, so it's showing Google
                  search that
                  you are interacting, and your site is being regularly updated, when sites go dormant, or nothing ever
                  changes or gets updated on a website, Google will eventually downgrade that site in search, because it
                  thinks it's abandoned, so you want to make sure that you're constantly updating your site. Let's face
                  it,
                  no one reads anymore, on average people spend eight seconds on a home page, with that and the move to
                  mobile, and the fact that people are on their mobile devices. No one's eating long sections of text
                  anymore, so that having a blog section is beneficial, because it's going to keep your homepage clean.
                  You're going to be able to keep your homepage very direct, and headline driven and then you're going
                  to
                  have the benefit for SEO of your blog post, which is going to be keyword rich, and content rich, and
                  link
                  rich.</p>
